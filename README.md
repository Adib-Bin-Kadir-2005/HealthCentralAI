## üìñ About the Project

**Health Central AI** is built to deliver **accurate, evidence-based responses** during critical moments ‚Äî such as medical emergencies or mental health challenges.

The platform empowers users with:
- Instant **first aid instructions**
- Grounded **mental health support**
- Conversational **general wellness guidance**

## ‚ùì Why Health Central AI?

Emergencies and emotional crises don‚Äôt wait ‚Äî and neither should help.

- ü©π Most people are unaware of **proper first aid procedures**.
- üßò Many suffer from **anxiety and stress** without support.
- üí¨ Existing chatbots often lack **domain-specific intelligence**.

**Health Central AI** bridges that gap with an AI model trained on **doctor-annotated medical data**, ensuring reliable help is always a message away.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

We implemented a **two-tiered response system**:

### üß¨ 1. Custom AI Model (First Aid & Mental Health)
- Built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**
- Trained on **doctor-annotated data**
- Utilizes a **neural network-based architecture**
- Handles queries related to **first aid scenarios and mental health support**

### ü§ñ 2. Gemini API (General Queries)
- Handles **non-medical or casual conversations**
- Ensures a seamless, intelligent chat experience even beyond our model‚Äôs scope
